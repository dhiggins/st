"Capital Area Asset Builders","CAAB_Tory_M.JPG","torym@savetogether.org","Tory","Myles","Washington","DC","education","$1,500 ","Compared to most 18-year-old college freshmen, Tory is a master of personal finance. Growing up as the older daughter of a single mom raising two kids in DC's Ward 8, finances were tight and managing debt was always an issue. As a result, Tory learned at an early age about prioritizing wants versus needs and the importance of savings. The financial education she received through CAAB's matched savings program taught her about budgeting for unexpected expenses and the heavy burden of debt, and now Tory is the go-to financial advisor for her friends and family.

Determined to be in control of her financial future, Tory set the bar high when she applied to college. She made it a goal to fund her education all by herself through scholarships and her own savings, including the matched savings account. “When I was applying to college, [my mom] was considering opening a loan for me to go to school, but I told her, 'Mom, I will find a way -- loans should not be your first option.'”

Now a freshman at Virginia Commonwealth University, Tory is the first person in her family to go to college.  To help meet her goal of graduating from college debt-free, she contributes at least $10 a month to her matched savings account from the money she earns from internships and other jobs. Funds from her account have helped pay for some of her school expenses, including books and tuition. “There are just so many college expenses that you don't think of that come up out of nowhere ...the matched savings account has helped me along that way.” Tory hopes to make her funds last at least through her junior year, and with her savvy budgeting, we're sure she will."
"Capital Area Asset Builders","CAAB_Anibal_V.JPG","anibalv@savetogether.org","Anibal","Virhuez","Washington","DC","education","$1,000 ","Three years ago, at the age of 33, Anibal emigrated from Peru, leaving behind his family and homeland in search of better opportunities in the U.S. His application to business school had been denied, but Anibal's drive to build a successful life was not deterred. 

Anibal knew it would be difficult coming alone without any family in the United States and with limited English skills. But he was up to the challenge, and immigrant support resources in D.C. led him to CAAB, where he started a matched savings account to continue his education in America. Anibal recognizes the importance of education for moving up the ladder of opportunity, and he is using his matched savings account to take English classes at Montgomery College. “After I complete my education, I will be in a better position to get a better job.”

He is working hard to improve his English and plans to take the TOEFL test soon, with the aspiration to attend Georgetown University's Certification in Business and Professional English program. Anibal admits he has found it challenging to learn a new language as an adult and balance his several jobs and classes. To keep himself on track towards reaching his savings goal and completing his education, Anibal has developed a strict budget to ensure that he is saving regularly, often exceeding his goal of saving $50 a month in his account. As a reminder of his goal, Anibal keeps a sticker of the Georgetown University mascot, a bulldog, on his computer, so he is reminded each time he sits down that second chances do exist."
"Capital Area Asset Builders","CAAB_Michelle_A.JPG","michellea@savetogether.org","Michelle","Andrews","Washington","DC","home","$1,000 ","Michelle learned discipline at a young age. Growing up in D.C., her mother taught her about managing finances and prioritizing rent at the top of her expenses. She harnessed her self-discipline as a means to success; she attended graduate school for Mental Health Administration and worked as an accomplished physical therapist for many years. Yet while she was flourishing professionally, underneath she was fighting a long battle with substance abuse.

After 20 years of struggling with addiction she found herself without a home. Fighting to regain her self-discipline, she enrolled in a treatment program. With the support of her counselors and family she took control of her addiction. Realizing the importance of keeping herself grounded, Michelle now works as a counselor for individuals coming out of detox at the same organization she went to for treatment.

Michelle sees owning her own home as the next step in her transformation. She loves the peaceful nature of her apartment and its close proximity to her family, and looks forward to one day calling it her own. She makes regular monthly deposits into her matched savings account towards its purchase, marking the days on her calendar when she'll visit the bank.

She recognizes the significance of the mandatory six-month savings period and plans to continue saving regularly each month after she graduates from CAAB's program. ""It makes me feel good to have followed through and to be responsible for something, and on a consistent basis."" She encourages positive thinking and recommends writing down one's goals and creating visuals as strong motivators. Michelle continues to stay true to her goals: the first check she writes every month is for rent and the second is for her matched savings account deposit. Now that's what we call self-discipline."
