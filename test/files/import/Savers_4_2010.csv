"EARN","EARN_Clara_M.jpg","sfearn+claram@savetogether.org","Clara","McDaniel","San Francisco","CA","Home",2000,"""No right now doesn't mean no forever,"" says Clara M. to herself so that she sets aside savings each month. ""Look at the big picture. Look at what you'll get down the road if you do without some things today.  You can always get them later.""

Clara's dream is to own her own home for the first time in her life.  Nothing extravagant - just something that is comfortable and safe.  Maybe a place that has a big yard for her 4 grandchildren to stretch out in.  Although she was born and raised in San Francisco, she is open to moving from the city to anywhere she can afford.

To support her savings and eventual mortgage payments, Clara will continue on as an Insurance Assistant in the National Sales Department of Liberty Mutual Group Insurance, where she has worked for the past four years. At night, she works with the Lorraine Hansberry Theatre as an actress/singer.  In her accompanying photo, she is in costume for a 2009 holiday performance of ""Black Nativity.ﾔ 

She is proud to be providing a good example to her two adult children and her daughter in college while participating in EARN's program.  She has taken every class she could through EARN and has always kept up on what she needs to do to complete the program.  At one point she got derailed when she had to help her daughter pay for school, health care and other expenses. And weathering unforeseen expenses like car repairs has been difficult.  

But she is on track and is already planning for when she graduates from the EARN program.  Even after she has purchased her house and is paying her mortgage, she will use the financial management skills she learned and the discipline she has honed to set aside additional savings just for emergencies and unforeseen circumstances.  And she will work on getting her college-aged daughter to participate in a matched savings program for education so that her daughter can have as transformative an experience as she did."

But she didnﾒt always have those skills; sheﾒs had to learn them the hard way. In 2000, at the age of 18, Erica moved to DC to attend Howard University. With no money in the bank and a lot of debt, she had to keep adding hours to her work schedule, squeezing out the time for classes and studying. 

Then when she got pregnant, Erica further struggled to balance all of her responsibilities and decided to quit school entirely. But giving birth to her now three-year-old son was a pivotal moment for her. As she worked to create a safe home environment for her new family, she began to understand the need for financial stability for her and her sonﾒs future. She sought out available resources, and was connected to CAAB. Through CAABﾒs Money Management 101 course she re-learned and re-instilled in her principles that her mother, who passed away when Erica was 11, taught her as a child. 

 Now, 10 years after she began her undergraduate studies, Erica is ready to finish what she started. She will use her IDA to take classes this summer and hopes to graduate later this year. She has grown to appreciate the significance of a quality education so much that it has become her core parenting principle. Erica has already begun educating her son about money and the importance of distinguishing wants versus needs. Reflecting on her former self, Erica feels transformed from when she first arrived to DC. Her smile radiates as she speaks about making the American dream her own, and just like her, we cannot wait to see how bright her future will be.  "

Thatﾒs why when she and her husband, Randy, got married last January, they agreed to skip the big traditional wedding and get married in the courthouse. ﾓWeﾒll have our reception in our new home, and it will be a reception and a housewarming all rolled into one,ﾔ she says.

This attitude of joyfully cutting back spending to save for a home has influenced every member of their family. Their kids have given up eating out on Friday nights, and Randy unwinds at the end of the day at home instead of going to happy hour with his buddies. Keyona, however, still has to fight the temptation to spend. ﾓThe Citibank we go to is right next to a shoe store. So every month when I go, Iﾒm looking at the store, but then my kids say, ﾑMom, donﾒt forget, we need to be in the house by December, so we can have Christmas in our own house.ﾒﾔ

To Keyona and Randy, owning their own home means permanence for their family and security into retirement. Growing up, neither Keyonaﾒs mother nor her grandmother owned their own home, so to her itﾒs important that they buy a house as an example for the kids. Itﾒs also about stability: ﾓIf you own your home, no one can put you out - they canﾒt say you have to leave as long as youﾒre paying your mortgageﾅItﾒs yours, youﾒve worked for it, so you have that sense of ownership. You can actually say this is my place, and you can see where your money goes.ﾔ"
